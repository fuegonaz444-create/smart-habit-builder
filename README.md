## :pushpin: Project Overview
**Smart Habit Builder** is a full-stack web application developed as the **Final Major Project** for the WeIntern Data Science/AI Internship. 

Unlike standard to-do lists, this application focuses on **habit formation** by implementing "smart" streak logic—automatically resetting progress if a user misses a day—and visualizing consistency through real-time analytics. The UI is designed with a "Glassmorphism" aesthetic to provide a calming, focused user experience.

## :sparkles: Key Features

### :brain: Smart Logic
* **Auto-Reset Streaks:** The backend algorithm checks the last completion date. If you miss a day, the streak automatically resets to zero.
* **Daily Validation:** Prevents users from spamming the "complete" button; habits can only be marked done once per day.

### :bar_chart: Visual Analytics
* **Real-time Progress:** Integrated **Chart.js** to visualize streaks dynamically.
* **Streak Badges:** Visual indicators of your current consistency (e.g., :fire: 5 Day Streak).

### :art: Modern UI/UX
* **Aesthetic Design:** Built with a clean, dark-mode inspired interface using **Tailwind CSS**.
* **Responsive:** Fully functional on desktop and mobile devices.
* **Persistent Data:** Utilizes **SQLite** database to ensure user data is saved securely between sessions.
